# **Hidden Therapy Through Play: Functional Juggling with Children with Autism and Their Caregivers**

*Based on the work of **Miłosz Goślicki*****, circus educator and circus artist** in the **Podbeskidzie** region of Poland,
*written by Paulina Chodnicka,* Odskocznia Studio, Warsaw, Poland

## **Target Group**  
 This program was designed for a **small group of children with autism** and their **caregivers**. Two groups participated in total - each composed of **four children and their respective caregivers** - creating a **one-to-one dynamic** that fostered **trust, connection**, and **shared learning**.

---

## **Initial Context**  
 Miłosz Goślicki is a **professional circus artist** and **workshop leader** with years of experience in **movement-based education**. However, in terms of **Functional Juggling (FJ)**, he was just beginning his journey - having recently completed a **training with Craig Quat**.

Circus pedagogy remains relatively **unfamiliar** in the **Podbeskidzie region** of Poland. Hoping to change that, Miłosz reached out to the **President of the National Autism Society** (Bielsko-Biała branch) and organized an **open session** for local therapists. The response was immediate and heartfelt - one participant remarked, *“It was the first time in a long while that I genuinely had fun.”*

---

## **Project Goals**  
 The primary aims of the workshops were:

* To offer **rehabilitative experiences** through **movement and coordination**
* To create **joyful, meaningful interactions** between children and their caregivers
* To integrate **Functional Juggling** into local **therapeutic practice** through **demonstration and collaboration**

---

## **Setting and Tools**  
 Workshops took place **indoors**, with two **Juggle Boards** set up on tables and **open space** for movement exploration.  
 **Props included**:

* **Juggle Boards**
* **Rings, juggling balls, and bags**
* **Balloons**
* **Hula hoops**
* **Spinning plates**
* **Flower sticks**

The space was arranged for **flexibility** - participants could **move freely** or stay close to their caregiver as needed. This allowed each child to **find their own rhythm** and **level of engagement**.

---

## **Workshop Process**  
 The program ran for **six months**, with **biweekly 1-hour sessions**. In retrospect, one hour proved a bit long - especially for children who arrived tired after a full day of school and therapy. Based on this, Miłosz now recommends **shorter 40-minute sessions** for children on the **autism spectrum**, to **avoid overstimulation** and **maintain focus**.

In the first four months, sessions followed exercises learned in training with **Craig Quat** and **Jael Rodríguez** (Hula Hoop Integral). Activities included **juggle boards**, **rings**, and **collaborative tasks**. Once this foundation was in place, Miłosz introduced **customized games** and **themed variations**, such as **balloons** and playful improvisations based on the group’s energy and needs.

A key element was the **active participation of caregivers**. Every session was designed as a **shared experience** - not only to support the children but also to **strengthen bonds** between parents and children through **play and co-regulation**.

---

## **Organizational Dynamics**  
 Each group of **eight participants** (four children aged 7 to 14, plus four caregivers) was guided by **Miłosz as the sole facilitator**. While there were no additional assistants, the **deep involvement of parents** created a **co-supported learning environment**.

A beautiful and unexpected outcome was the **level of integration** that unfolded. Parents engaged with each other, with staff, and most importantly - with their children in **new and joyful ways**.

Even beyond the sessions, parents formed a **WhatsApp group**, remained in touch, and began attending **community events together**. Though modest in size, this network continues to **thrive organically**. The sense of **community-building** - so central to **contemporary circus culture** - took root naturally here.

---

## **Unexpected Observations**  
 While the original plan was for **biweekly sessions**, occasional **longer pauses** between meetings actually proved helpful. Families used the breaks to **process and rest**, returning with **renewed energy**.

Miłosz also received **inquiries from an inclusive kindergarten** and a **local library** interested in offering similar workshops. Most importantly, the experience gave him the **confidence to begin working with children under 7** - something he hadn’t considered before discovering **Functional Juggling**.

---

## **Results and Reflections**  
 Parents shared **enthusiastic feedback**, noting visible improvements in:

* **Coordination** (especially use of the **non-dominant hand**)
* **Physical engagement and motivation**
* **Willingness to participate in movement-based play**

A conversation with the **President of the Autism Society** revealed a deeper insight: many children are **overburdened**. Their schedules are packed with **school, therapy, and appointments**, leaving little room for joy. The word “therapy” alone can feel heavy. What she valued most about **Functional Juggling** was that it felt like **“hidden therapy.”** The children didn’t feel like they were working - they were simply **“throwing things with the juggling guy.”** And yet, **real developmental outcomes** were happening.

These included:
* **Sensory integration**
* **Social skill development**
* **Physical coordination**
* **Expressive movement and creative play**

Miłosz believes the method also touches on **art therapy**, especially when **rhythm, drawing**, or **music** are added. As participants begin to **internalize the patterns**, **expression becomes intuitive**.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

**Strong points**

* **High adaptability** across age and cognitive needs

* **Genuine caregiver–child bonding**

* **Community engagement** beyond sessions

* **Meaningful participation** without pressure

**Lessons learned**

* **Session length** must be tailored to avoid fatigue

* **Scheduling and pacing** are critical for long-term inclusion

---

## **Final Reflection**  
 After a year of applying the method, one truth stands out: **Functional Juggling is genuinely inclusive**. Its inherent **flexibility and responsiveness** allow for **deep personalization** - whether a participant is **highly active, non-verbal, easily overwhelmed**, or **slow to warm up**. With the right **rhythm and relationship**, everyone can find their own way to participate.
