#  Where Movement Finds Us - Inclusive circus in a Therapeutic Group Context

Written by Jael Rodriguez, Hula Hoop Integral fundator. 

**Hula Hoop Integral** is a pedagogical and artistic project born in Latin America that explores the hoop as a tool for learning, expression, and social transformation. Its approach combines play, movement, and inclusion, offering accessible experiences for people of all ages and backgrounds. Through trainings, workshops, and community-based actions, the project fosters collaborative networks and sensitive methodologies centered on the body, creativity, and diversity.

## **Eastern Europe, 2023**  
 **Inclusive circus in a Therapeutic Group Context**

During the second half of 2023, as part of a pedagogical tour across Europe, I was invited by colleagues from the field of social circus to participate in a therapeutic space for neurodivergent youth between the ages of 8 and 15\. The center, located in Eastern Europe, was made up of an interdisciplinary team of educators, psychologists, and movement therapists who carried out individual and group sessions for children and adolescents with varying support needs.

At that time, I had been facilitating workshops across several European countries, including in schools, day centers, and creative settings, with a focus on *Juggling* and *Inclusive Hoop Practice*. This methodology promotes motor, sensory, and social development through a playful, expressive, and accessible approach. It provides tools and object manipulation techniques that are adapted to the individual and the context.

In this case, I joined as an external facilitator to support an ongoing process, offering a series of weekly sessions co-led with the local team.

## **Framework of the Process**

The sessions were held in a spacious room with padded flooring and access to materials such as mats, ropes, balls, scarves, and hoops. Each session lasted one hour, and the group was composed of five young participants and three adult facilitators. Some of the youth also attended individual sessions before or after the group activity.

The space was thoughtfully prepared to support sensory regulation, respectful interaction, and the autonomy of each participant. The proposed dynamics included movement circuits, coordination games, object-based exercises, and moments of shared observation, all driven by exploration rather than performance.

## **Objectives and Methodology**

The overall aim of the process was to support motor, cognitive, and social development through play with circus elements. More specifically, we aimed to:

* Stimulate visual-motor coordination and body awareness.
* Encourage interaction among peers in a safe, supportive environment.
* Promote positive, joyful experiences of movement and self-expression.

The *Hula hoop Integral* allowed each activity to be adapted to the group’s rhythms and needs, blending structure with flexibility. The goal was not to perform a “correct technique” but to offer meaningful experiences through repetition, spatial perception, rhythmic flow, and creative interaction.

## **Session Dynamics and Structure**

Each session followed a consistent three-part structure:
1. **Welcome and sensory warm-up**: breathing, gentle activation, and simple rhythmic games.
2. **Guided exploration with objects**: movement circuits, pair games, exchanges, or tossing activities depending on the day.
3. **Closing and farewell**: relaxation, observation, or free expression.

Some examples of activities included:
* Passing scarves in pairs.
* Synchronized walking with hoops placed on different body parts.
* Movement circuits involving balance, jumping, and object manipulation.
* Group improvisations in which each person proposed a movement to be replicated or transformed.

Each session was supported by at least two other adults in addition to myself, ensuring personalized attention and emotional grounding for the group.

## **Observed Changes**

Over the course of the process, we observed significant progress in several areas:

* **Motor skills**: improved balance, bilateral coordination, and manipulation confidence.
* **Social engagement**: increased spontaneous interactions, shared attention, and cooperative actions that were initially rare or absent.
* **Expressive capacity**: visible enjoyment, independent play proposals, and growing openness to shared activities.

One of the most valuable aspects of the experience was sustaining a group environment in which every participant could feel included—without pressure, without judgment, and with enough emotional support to explore from a place of curiosity and pleasure.

## **Challenges and Learning**

The process was not without its challenges. Some sessions were affected by fatigue or emotional dysregulation among participants, requiring on-the-spot adjustments to reduce stimulation or simplify the activity. Communication among facilitators also presented obstacles due to language differences, which encouraged us to rely more on visual cues, gestures, and relational presence.

One of the most meaningful lessons was recognizing the importance of the group’s inner rhythm and how each person contributes something essential through their own unique way of being. I also reaffirmed the value of facilitating without imposing—allowing responses to arise from the relationship itself rather than from instruction.

## **Conclusion**

This experience confirmed the potential of  Inclusive Circus Spaces as a tool for bridging body, emotion, and connection. Without the need for constant verbalization or standardized goals, the group experienced genuine moments of discovery, coordination, expression, and belonging.

By cultivating a shared movement language and inviting participation without pressure or hierarchy, the group became a space where joy, focus, and connection could take root—offering meaningful support for both individual development and collective well-being.
