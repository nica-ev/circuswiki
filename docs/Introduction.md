# Prolog
The world of circus pedagogy is in the midst of a quiet but powerful shift. For a long time, circus in education was seen as something mostly for kids—playful, physical, and rooted in learning a specific set of technical tricks. But across the globe, a growing wave of practitioners is pushing beyond that narrow frame. They’re showing that the circus can be something much more: a tool for inclusion, for connection, and for deep personal and social transformation.

This publication offers a window into that evolving landscape. It brings together case studies from educators and facilitators across Europe who are reimagining what circus can look like — and who it can be for. Through their stories, we see how movement, play, and presence are being used to open new doors for learning, healing, and community building.

The case studies that follow are more than workshop summaries. They’re reflections of this cultural shift. They offer windows into how these methods come alive—in kindergartens, in care homes, in refugee shelters, in classrooms, in gymnasiums. And they remind us, again and again, what becomes possible when we shift the question away from performance and toward presence. From “can they juggle?” to “how can we meet them where they are?”

This book is a collection of those moments. And maybe, if we’re lucky, an invitation to create more of them.
