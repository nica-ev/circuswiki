# **Functional Juggling to Support Writing Tool Proficiency in a Child with ADHD**

## **Initial Challenge**

A 9-year-old boy diagnosed with ADHD began attending my circus school in New Jersey, accompanied by his mother, who was seeking support for his struggles with handwriting. Despite being physically capable and cognitively sharp, he found writing frustrating and unengaging. Completing assignments was a battle, and he had developed a strong aversion to the tools themselves. His mother believed his low academic performance was directly tied to his ADHD.

Rather than addressing handwriting directly, I introduced **Functional Juggling** as a way to shift the entire **emotional and sensory relationship** with writing tools. My goal wasn’t just to improve motor control, but to reframe how he experienced the activity—transforming it from a task he dreaded into a game he could enjoy.

## **Creating Playful Repetition**

We began with the **Juggle Board**, using its structured rhythm and nonverbal language to spark curiosity. Once he was engaged in that system of play, I replaced the board with a large sheet of paper and swapped the juggling balls for five **colored markers**.

We used the same **sequencing logic**—picking up, passing, and placing the markers—to draw mirrored patterns across the page. Instead of copying letters or words, he was exploring movement through color and shape, with each drawing forming part of a fluid, rhythmic sequence.

## **Engagement Through Creativity**

He embraced the format quickly—especially when we incorporated **creative themes** like animals, houses, or imaginary creatures. These themes required not only motor coordination, but also **interpretation, adaptation, and collaboration**. They brought the task to life.

We told stories through drawings. We made jokes. We improvised. Sometimes we worked in silence, other times we built elaborate worlds together. His **attention and motivation exceeded all expectations**. At the end of each session, he took home his drawings with pride—something he could show, share, and revisit.

## **Progress Through Play**

What stood out wasn’t just the technical progress—it was the emotional shift. During our first session, he told me he thought writing was “stupid.” By the end, he didn’t want to put the markers down. He was excited to show his work to his sister. That shift was rapid—and real.

Over time, his **motor control, bilateral coordination, and cross-midline movement** improved significantly. His **writing proficiency** surpassed expectations. But more importantly, his relationship to the tools had changed. He no longer resisted. He wanted to engage.

## **Reflections and Outcomes**

His mother was pleased—especially by the academic gains. But for me, the deeper transformation was social-emotional. What had once been a source of stress and shame had become a **point of pride and connection**.

This case reminded me that juggling isn’t just about movement. It’s about how we relate to objects, to rhythm, to ourselves. In this case, it was about a pencil—or, more precisely, what the pencil had come to represent.

By meeting this child in play, we rewrote his emotional script. We created space for autonomy, expression, and joy. We didn’t just train a skill—we **transformed a relationship**.

## **Scalability and Application**

This approach requires minimal resources and can be replicated across classrooms, clinics, or home settings. Educators, therapists, and caregivers can adapt the structure using simple tools like markers, paper, or everyday objects—so long as the guiding principles remain:

* **Structured repetition**  
* **Embodied rhythm**  
* **Playful interaction**

When we offer movement-based learning in a joyful, accessible format, we don’t just teach skills—we help build confidence, reshape perception, and create lasting emotional resilience.
