# Monokyklo

Monokyklo is a youth and social circus school based in Thessaloniki, Greece, established in 2017. Our main aim is to share the arts of circus, dance, and theatre with children and youth as a means of artistic expression, pedagogical approach, and physical and mental development.

We believe that the circus teaches essential life skills. For this reason, our team is often present in different communities and among socially disadvantaged groups, where we teach circus and co-create performances.

Our team includes artists, pedagogues, youth workers, psychologists, circus trainers, and animators, all with many years of field experience in diverse social contexts.

In our dedicated circus space, we offer regular classes in circus, dance, and yoga throughout the year, open to all ages.
