# **Weaving Routines in Confinement – An Online Hula Hoop Workshop (2021)**

## **Participant Profile**  
 This experience took place during the global lockdown of 2021\. The workshop was delivered online and aimed at a group of ten self-identified women between the ages of 20 and 46\. Some were independent practitioners, while others belonged to educational or artistic institutions. The common thread was the shared need to reconnect with movement, play, and creation in a time marked by isolation.

## **Context and Intent**  
 The classes were facilitated by Jael Rodríguez within the framework of the **Hula Hoop Integral** and **Functional Juggling** methodologies. At the time, these practices were already being shared and explored in different territories, and their adaptability to digital contexts was part of the learning process.

The intention was not only to learn new skills but to approach technical language through **body awareness**, **accessibility**, and **experimentation**. The process invited each participant to explore composition from a space of autonomy and collective sensitivity - reconnecting with the body through play during lockdown.

## **Objectives**

* To offer playful and pedagogical tools for composing movement with hula hoops
* To share the conceptual and practical foundations of Functional Juggling adapted for the digital context
* To build a shared time and space for movement, imagination, and creation from home

## **Structure and Tools**  
 Sessions were held via videoconference. The diversity of domestic spaces and internet conditions required a flexible approach and great creativity. Participants used the materials they had on hand: **hula hoops, balls, scarves, rings, socks, or fruit**.

The virtual space itself became part of the process, with **pauses, improvisations, and adaptations** that enriched the dynamic. There was no assistant in the sessions, but ongoing support was offered via **group chat and email**. The group was closely accompanied in their processes, encouraging **peer exchange and feedback**.

Each session followed a consistent structure:
* Warm-up and regulation using breath, rhythm, and body mapping
* Sensory and technical exploration with hula hoops and/or household objects
* Creative task or compositional challenge
* Group sharing and reflection (when bandwidth and time allowed)

## **Pedagogical Adaptations**  
 Some of the **Functional Juggling** principles adapted to the online and hula hoop format included:

* The **Five Step Learning Model**, beginning with three elements simultaneously rather than adding one by one
* The replacement of toss juggling with **contact-based variations**, such as rolling or gliding across the body or floor
* The **use of the floor** as a key platform for developing pattern consistency
* The **design of spatial sequencing maps**, allowing participants to interact with fixed structures similar to the Juggle Board using multiple hoops instead of balls
* Awareness of **camera framing** as part of composition, encouraging spatial perception and orientation

## **Outcomes and Impact**  
 The initial goal of facilitating an enjoyable and expressive learning space was achieved. Beyond that, several participants who had never used more than one or two objects at once reported breakthroughs with multi-object patterns. Many managed to replicate elements of the methodology in their own teaching or artistic practices.

The creative capacity of the group turned **limitations into possibilities**. This revealed not only the flexibility of Functional Juggling but also the richness of hula hoop as a **vehicle for inclusion and bodily composition**.

Participants developed:
* Increased capacity to explore **multi-object compositions**
* A sense of connection and **collective creativity**, even in a virtual format
* Confidence to integrate new approaches into their own educational or performative work

## **Challenges and Creative Deviations**  
 Unstable internet connections, limited physical space, and improvisation with non-traditional objects were common. But these deviations, far from being a problem, **strengthened collective trust and flexibility**—turning each obstacle into part of the path.

Sometimes a lack of materials led to improvisation. A piece of fruit or a pillow could replace a hoop. A toddler interrupting class became an opportunity for laughter and group bonding. These moments of **relational presence and spontaneity** helped deepen the process.

## **Final Reflection**  
 One of the most meaningful aspects of this experience was the **possibility of building shared time**, where the body - even at a distance - became a bridge of connection. The screen was not just a limitation; it was also a stage for **mutual listening and observation**.

*“I never thought I could juggle with more than two hoops. Now not only do I do it—I teach it to my students.”*  
 — Participant feedback

This case study affirms the capacity of inclusive circus pedagogy to adapt to new formats while maintaining its core intention: to create **sensitive, joyful, and meaningful learning environments**, even under constraint.
