# **Functional Juggling as a Tool for Motor Development and Social Integration in a Job Training Context**

## **Setting the Scene**

A 26-year-old man with Down syndrome was attending a job training center in New Jersey several times a week. His goal: to develop the practical skills needed for employment in a restaurant. One of those skills was pouring water into glasses—a deceptively simple task that, in practice, required a combination of motor coordination, focus, and timing.

The original intervention had him repeat the action with one hand, always from the same side, and without crossing his body or engaging socially. It was rigid, repetitive, and disconnected from real restaurant environments. And crucially—it didn’t motivate him.

## **A Functional Juggling Approach**

That’s where Functional Juggling came in.

I introduced a playful, rhythmic system using the **Juggle Board** to create a foundation of patterned, bilateral movement. Once this rhythm was established, we transitioned to **cups of water—five on each side**—exchanging water instead of balls. The goal wasn’t just to reduce spillage; it was to build coordination, cognitive flexibility, and the ability to *move while staying socially present*.

This participant was highly social—something that had previously been labeled as a distraction. But in our sessions, his social nature became a strength. The structure allowed him to stay physically active while engaging in conversation. Verbal prompts became unnecessary. He followed the **nonverbal cues and visual rhythms** built into the practice to guide each movement.

## **Structure and Tracking Progress**

Each session lasted around 12 minutes and followed a consistent structure. To monitor progress, we filled **five glasses with exactly 5 ounces** of water each (25 ounces total). After each session, we measured how much remained to calculate the amount spilled.

In the **first session**, he spilled nearly half—about 12 ounces. But he remained motivated and fully engaged. By the **third session**, that loss had dropped to less than 4 ounces.

The improvement wasn’t just in the numbers—it was in the quality of movement and joy of participation.

## **A Shift in Repetition and Engagement**

Before Functional Juggling, traditional sessions involved about **200–300 repetitions over 40 minutes**, often with waning focus. With Functional Juggling, in just 12 minutes, he reached **over 600 repetitions**—not out of pressure, but from continuous, rhythmic play. The high-volume repetition was embedded in a format that felt fun, natural, and self-reinforcing.

Even more significant was the change in *form*. He began to use both hands, work across his midline, and maintain fluidity. He started experimenting—changing timing, alternating patterns, improvising. These were signs not just of improvement, but of ownership. He wasn’t just practicing the task—he was playing *inside* it.

## **Transfer of Skill and Recognition**

The transfer to real-world settings was immediate. He was cleared to handle water-pouring duties at the restaurant where he was training.

* His **supervisor** noticed improved posture, confidence, and initiative.  
* His **therapist** praised the method and began integrating elements into broader programming.  
* His **parents** were amazed at how proudly he demonstrated his new skill at home.

## **Scalability and Application**

This model of Functional Juggling can be implemented with minimal resources and adapted across many support settings. Therapists and educators can recreate the structure using cups, markers, or other everyday objects—focusing on **high-repetition, low-pressure engagement**.

By maintaining a rhythm-based structure that supports **bilateral movement**, **social connection**, and **playful interaction**, the method scales easily for one-on-one or small group use. Its benefits extend to **neurodiverse learners** and individuals working on **life skills**—offering a pathway to **confidence**, **autonomy**, and **skill mastery** through accessible embodied play.
